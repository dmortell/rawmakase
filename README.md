RAWmakase is a fast, non-destructive RAW photo developer for Linux and macOS, written in Rust. It opens RAW files from any camera LibRaw supports, develops them with a Lightroom-style set of controls, and exports JPEG or 16-bit TIFF. It can also import a Lightroom Classic catalog with its ratings, flags, labels, keywords and compatible develop settings, without ever writing to the original catalog or your photos.

It is a personal project in active development. Rendering aims for close, not exact, Lightroom parity; see [parity gaps](docs/parity-gaps.md).

## Features

- **Develop**: white balance and picker, one-click Auto white balance and tone, exposure and tone, Shadows/Highlights, Clarity, Dehaze, point curves and levels, HSL color mixer, three-way color grading, detail (denoise and sharpening), crop, straighten and Transform, lens corrections, effects and calibration.
- **Spot removal and masks (experimental, early)**: Heal and Clone spots and brushed areas with automatic sources, and brush, gradient and range masks with local adjustments, also imported from Lightroom. Not yet measured against Lightroom.
- **Library**: SQLite catalogs, folders and collections, ratings, flags, color labels, keywords, filtering, and non-destructive Lightroom `.lrcat` import with folder relinking.
- **Presets and profiles**: Lightroom XMP presets, plus DCP and XMP camera profiles you import yourself.
- **Non-destructive**: originals are never modified. Edits live in the catalog, and all writes are atomic.
- **Fast previews**: a quick draft first, then full quality, with GPU finishing (Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux) and CPU fallback.
- **Command line**: inspect, render, export thumbnails, import catalogs and benchmark without the GUI.

## Coming soon

- LUT support
- AI-powered masks and object removal
- Built-in open source preset library
- Agentic features: e.g. culling assistance

## Install

Download the package for your system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pch/rawmakase/releases). Older releases may have only the original Arch-built Linux archive; use the requirements in that release's notes.

### macOS (15 or newer)

Choose `rawmakase-v<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` for Apple Silicon or `rawmakase-v<version>-macos-x86_64.dmg` for Intel. Open the DMG, drag **RAWmakase** into **Applications**, and launch it there. Release DMGs are signed and notarized, and include their imaging libraries; Homebrew is not required.

### Linux (x86_64)

Download the package, then run the matching command from its folder, replacing the filename with the one you downloaded:

| System | Package | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+ | `.deb` | `sudo apt install ./rawmakase_<version>_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora 43+ | `.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./rawmakase-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm` |
| Arch Linux | `.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U ./rawmakase-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` |

DEB/RPM packages include LibRaw and Little CMS. Arch packages use system dependencies. A working graphics driver is required; install your desktop's `xdg-desktop-portal` backend for native file dialogs.

**AUR publication is paused.** Install the Arch package directly, or download and extract `rawmakase-<version>-arch-recipe.tar.gz` into an empty folder and build as a normal user:

```sh
makepkg -si
```

The development recipe is in [packaging/arch/rawmakase-git](packaging/arch/rawmakase-git/PKGBUILD).

The `rawmakase-<version>-x86_64-linux.tar.gz` download contains the same bundled imaging libraries as the DEB/RPM packages. Extract it and run `./usr/bin/rawmakase` from the extracted folder. Keep the whole directory together. It requires the same OS/runtime baseline as the packages above; it is not a fully static build.

### Updates and verification

To update, download a newer release and repeat the installation steps (replace the app in Applications on macOS). Settings and catalogs are kept separately from the installed application. There is currently no in-app updater or automatic package repository.

Each new packaged release includes `SHA256SUMS`. After downloading it beside your package, verify downloaded files on Linux with `sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS`. On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 <downloaded-file>` and compare the result with that file's entry in `SHA256SUMS`.

### From source (Linux and macOS)

You need Rust 1.98 or newer, a C++17 compiler with OpenMP, pkg-config, LibRaw 0.22 or newer, and Little CMS 2.

- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S rust base-devel pkgconf libraw lcms2`
- macOS: `brew install pkg-config libraw little-cms2 libomp`. Use a native rustup toolchain (`aarch64-apple-darwin` on Apple Silicon); `LIBOMP_PREFIX` points the build at a non-Homebrew OpenMP.

```sh
make                                  # cargo build --release --locked
make install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"    # binary, desktop entry, icon and licenses
```

`make install` never builds, so `make && sudo make install PREFIX=/usr` does not compile as root. `make uninstall` removes the installed files.

On macOS, `packaging/macos/app.sh` builds `target/release/RAWmakase.app`, which you can open from Finder. It uses the Homebrew libraries installed on your Mac and is not a signed, self-contained distribution.

## Usage

```sh
rawmakase                     # reopen the last catalog
rawmakase Photos.rawmakase    # open a catalog
rawmakase photo.dng           # add the photo's folder to the last catalog and edit it
```

Photos are edited through the Library. A photo dropped onto the window or passed on the command line has its folder added to the open catalog, then opens in Develop; edits it got in earlier releases (its `photo.rawmakase.json`) come along. You can also drop a catalog onto the window. The first launch offers to create a catalog or import a Lightroom catalog; both are available later from the **Catalog** menu. The camera's embedded JPEG shows immediately while the RAW develops.

Useful shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left / Right | Previous / next photo |
| F / Z | Fit / toggle Fit and 100% |
| 0–5, 6–9 | Rating; red, yellow, green, blue label |
| P / X / U | Pick / reject / clear flag |
| Shift + rating, label or flag key | Apply and advance |
| R or C | Crop |
| J | Clipping indicators |
| Backslash | Before / after |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Z, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo / redo |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U | Auto white balance and tone |

Double-click a slider to reset it, or type its value for precision.

### Camera profiles

RAWmakase does not ship any camera profiles. Without one, it renders with the camera matrix LibRaw provides. For Lightroom-like color, import DCP and XMP profiles you are licensed to use (for example from your own Lightroom or Camera Raw installation, or published third-party DCPs such as RawTherapee's) with **Edit → Import profiles…** or `rawmakase import-profiles`. They are copied into RAWmakase's own data directory. See [Lightroom profiles](docs/lightroom-profiles.md).

### Command line

```sh
rawmakase inspect photo.dng
rawmakase thumbnail photo.dng embedded.jpg
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.jpg --exposure 0.7 --max-edge 2400
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.tiff --xmp preset.xmp
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.jpg --auto
rawmakase import-catalog Lightroom.lrcat Photos.rawmakase
rawmakase help
```

`render` applies the photo's saved edits unless `--recipe` or `--xmp` supplies settings, and it needs `--overwrite` to replace an existing file.

### Where data lives

- Edits for photos opened outside a catalog: `photo.dng.rawmakase.json` next to the RAW (spots and masks in `photo.dng.rawmakase-local.json`), or in the data directory's `sidecars/` folder for read-only locations.
- Catalogs: the `.rawmakase` file you choose.
- Profiles, presets, previews and session state: `~/Library/Application Support/RAWmakase` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rawmakase` (default `~/.local/share/rawmakase`) on Linux. `RAWMAKASE_DATA_DIR` overrides it.

Exports are always sRGB. The display defaults to sRGB; pick a monitor ICC profile under **More** only if your compositor does not already manage color.

## Development

Start with the [code map](docs/code-map.md) and the [architecture guide](docs/architecture.md).

```sh
make check    # cargo fmt --check, clippy -D warnings, cargo test
```

The repository contains no RAW photos, Lightroom catalogs or camera profiles, so tests that need them are ignored by default. Run them with your own files:

| Environment variable | Test target | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAWMAKASE_FIXTURES` | `--test raw_fixtures` | A folder of RAW files (the test currently expects both a Bayer and an X-Trans file) |
| `RAWMAKASE_PROFILES` | `--test private_profiles` | A folder of DCP files |
| `RAWMAKASE_TEST_DCP` | `--lib camera_profiles` | A DCP file (the assertions currently match RawTherapee's `SONY ILCE-7M2.dcp`) |
| `RAWMAKASE_LRCAT` | `--lib catalog` | A Lightroom catalog |

```sh
RAWMAKASE_FIXTURES=~/raw-fixtures cargo test --release --test raw_fixtures -- --ignored --nocapture
```

GPU tests are ignored as well; run them with `cargo test --lib gpu -- --ignored` on a machine with a compute adapter.

CI runs `make check`, a release build, an Arch package build and a `cargo deny` license and advisory audit on every push and pull request. A stable `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` matching `Cargo.toml` builds both macOS DMGs and the Linux packages. Publication waits for Apple notarization and package checks. See [packaging/RELEASING.md](packaging/RELEASING.md) for credentials, rehearsal runs, supported systems and the AUR pause.
