# Code map

Use this page to find an implementation or decide where a change belongs. Read
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for ownership rules, concurrency invariants and
compatibility constraints. Paths below are relative to this document and clickable.
Module roots (`mod.rs`) define their public API; implementation helpers generally
remain private to their domain. This is one Rust package, not a multi-crate workspace.

| [export/metadata.rs](../src/export/metadata.rs) | Selected EXIF/TIFF metadata and descriptions; avoids copying unsafe source offsets and maker notes. |

## Desktop application

The desktop owns interaction and task coordination. Panels use the domain APIs
above rather than implementing SQL, file formats or pixel processing.

### State and operation policy

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [app/mod.rs](../src/app/mod.rs) | `Editor`, initialization, lifecycle, worker connections and explicit session-write destination. |
| [state.rs](../src/app/state.rs) | Separate document, decoded-image pair, preview, viewport and preset-browser state; centralized document reset. |
| [history.rs](../src/app/history.rs) | Bounded undo/redo, redo-branch invalidation and one transaction per editing gesture. |
| [editing.rs](../src/app/editing.rs) | Before/after frame snapshots bound to a document generation so navigation cannot mix histories. |

| [dialogs.rs](../src/app/dialogs.rs) | Typed dialog intents and native file/folder choosers. |
| [catalog.rs](../src/app/catalog.rs) | UI workflows for native catalogs, Lightroom import, folder addition, relinking and applying imported edits. |

| [toolbar.rs](../src/app/toolbar.rs) | Develop toolbar and menus. |
| [export.rs](../src/app/export.rs) | Export dialog, remembered export settings, background exports and their progress. |

### Background work

| File | Responsibility |

| [worker/latest.rs](../src/app/worker/latest.rs) | Single-slot mailbox: submitting a new job replaces pending work rather than growing a queue. |
| [worker/loader.rs](../src/app/worker/loader.rs) | RAW metadata/profile/sidecar loading, embedded preview, the half-size then full decoded image and neighboring thumbnails. |
| [worker/renderer.rs](../src/app/worker/renderer.rs) | Fit previews, reduced-then-full 100% regions, cancellation, monitor conversion and clipping overlays. |

## How an operation moves through the app

1. **Open a photo:** workspace/dialog/catalog actions enter `app::workflow`. It
   flushes the old document, resets document state, starts a load generation and
   submits a loader job. The loader uses `raw`, `camera_profiles` and `storage`.
   `app::events` accepts only current results. A saved catalog recipe, when present,
   replaces the loader's resolved defaults for a catalog photo.
2. **Edit and preview:** panels change the recipe. `app::editing` and `history`
   group the change; save policy marks it pending. `workflow` submits the effective
   recipe and viewport to the renderer. The worker calls `develop`; engine 3 previews optionally finish sharpening/resizing on the GPU, then the worker performs
   display conversion. Accepted results become preview textures. Drafts are
   followed by a full-quality fit or region result.
3. **Save edits:** workspace autosave and navigation/close flushing call
   `workflow`; autosave writes in the background (`autosave`), and flushing
   waits for it before saving synchronously. Catalog photos save through `catalog`; standalone photos use
   `storage::sidecar`. Protected edits cannot autosave, and failed writes remain
   pending for retry. Presets are separately saved reusable recipes.
4. **Export:** foreground activity coordinates destination/overwrite handling.
   The export job captures the recipe, renders through the development API, then
   calls `export` to encode and publish. Output embeds sRGB independently of the
   monitor profile. Navigation is held during export.
5. **Apply a preset:** `presets` discovers assets, `xmp` parses/translates Adobe
   settings, and the app handles compatibility and hover state. Hover is temporary;
   application commits a recipe through the editing/history flow.
6. **Import Lightroom:** the app or CLI calls `catalog::lightroom`. It reads a
   source snapshot, preserves source data, transfers relationships, and publishes
   a new native catalog. Develop translation is best effort and reports unsupported
   settings; it does not promise Lightroom rendering parity.

## Where data lives

`storage::data_dir()` selects `RAWMAKASE_DATA_DIR` when set. Otherwise it uses
`~/Library/Application Support/RAWmakase` on macOS and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rawmakase`
(default `~/.local/share/rawmakase`) on Linux.

| Data | Location and lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| Original RAW and Lightroom catalog | User-selected source files; treated as read-only. |
| Standalone edits | Adjacent `photo.ARW.rawmakase.json` / `photo.RAF.rawmakase.json`, plus `photo.ARW.rawmakase-local.json` for spots and masks (experimental); identity-keyed JSON under the data directory's `sidecars/` when adjacent storage is unavailable. Protected conflicts must not be overwritten. |
| Native catalog | User-selected `.rawmakase` SQLite file; authoritative catalog metadata, edits and preserved import data. Spots and masks are in the `local_edits` table, raster data in `bitmaps`. |
| Native preset / exported photo | User-selected JSON / JPEG / TIFF destination. |
| Session preferences | `session.json` in the data directory; last path and monitor ICC path. UI tests inject a temporary destination or disable writes. |
| Preset favorites | `preset-favorites.json` in the data directory. |
| Installed assets | `xmp-presets/` and `camera-profiles/` under asset roots; shared discovery also checks the legacy XDG/Linux data location. Imported XMP files go to `xmp-presets/Imported/` under the current data directory. |
| Library previews | `previews.sqlite3` in the data directory; disposable cache, not a source of edits. |
| Decoded photos | `decoded/` in the cache directory (`~/Library/Caches/RAWmakase` on macOS, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rawmakase`, default `~/.cache/rawmakase`, on Linux; `RAWMAKASE_CACHE_DIR` overrides it): developed camera images of opened and prefetched photos, capped at 4 GB, least recently used removed first. Disposable. |
| Build output | `target/`; generated binaries, documentation and local macOS bundle. |

## Tests and reference tools

Most unit tests live alongside their implementation, either inline or in a
sibling `tests.rs`. Keep regressions with the domain that owns the behavior.

| [scripts/compare-preview.py](../scripts/compare-preview.py) | Compares resized sRGB previews without exposure/color fitting; distinct from the Rust comparison command. |

Use the [README checks](../README.md#checks) for the standard suite. Private fixture
checks require external data and are explicitly ignored by default. A passing
unit suite does not replace the photographic/manual checks in the validation docs.
