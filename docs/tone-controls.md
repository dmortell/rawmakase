# Basic panel tone controls

## Measurement

References are Camera Raw 18.6 renders from Photoshop 2026, the same engine and process version (2012, PV 15.4) as Lightroom Classic 15.5. `scripts/camera-raw-sweep.py` writes a Photoshop script that renders each slider at several positions with Adobe Standard, no lens profile and As Shot white balance. `scripts/lightroom-scorecard.py` re-renders every reference in RAWmakase from the settings embedded in it and reports the error. The 2026-09-26 set is three Fujifilm X100F and two Sony A7 II photos, 8 sliders × 6 positions, 2000 px. It is private and not in the repository.

Each adjusted render was compared with the default render of the same photo. For Contrast, Blacks and Whites, a single curve applied to the brightest and darkest channel in ProPhoto primaries with the sRGB transfer function (DNG RGBTone) explains the change to within 0.0015 MAE. That is the 8-bit quantization level of the comparison, so these sliders are global tone curves in that domain. The same curve fits every photo for Blacks and negative Whites. Contrast pivots at a photo-dependent point (0.41–0.51), and positive Whites stretches further on photos whose highlights are dim. Highlights, Shadows, Clarity and Dehaze leave spatial residuals and are local operators.

## Black point

Adobe's rendering subtracts a small black level before the tone curve: the DNG SDK exposure ramp, whose default Shadows setting maps to a black point with a quadratic toe. Without it, RAWmakase's deep shadows (display luminance 0.02–0.08) were 0.4–0.55 EV brighter than Camera Raw on every camera. Engine 4 applies the ramp after exposure, with the black at 0.0015 × 2^exposure in scene-linear units. That value was fitted to the Camera Raw defaults of three photos; the SDK's nominal 0.005 crushes shadows by about 1.2 EV here. Scorecards: X100F Lightroom references 0.0120 → 0.0096 MAE, Sony Camera Raw references 0.0088 → 0.0065.

## Engine 4 implementation

`src/develop/basic_tone.rs` applies Contrast → Whites → Blacks as one composed curve after the camera profile's tone curve and before the user's point curve. The curves are the measured averages in `basic_tone_data.rs`, interpolated between slider positions with 0 as the identity. They replace the earlier power-S contrast and luminance-weighted Whites/Blacks for engine 4. Older recipes keep their operators.

Extra MAE over the default render, averaged across the five photos (previous operators in parentheses):

| Slider | −100 | −50 | −25 | +25 | +50 | +100 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Contrast | −0.0009 | −0.0004 (+0.0107) | −0.0001 | +0.0001 | +0.0002 (+0.0061) | +0.0002 |
| Blacks | −0.0008 | +0.0007 (+0.0189) | +0.0007 | −0.0005 | −0.0004 (+0.0009) | +0.0005 |
| Whites | −0.0011 | −0.0010 (+0.0031) | −0.0005 | +0.0019 | +0.0091 (+0.0152) | +0.0577 |

### Shadows and Highlights

Offline fits on the sweeps show both are local operators whose effect is best explained in log luminance of the toned image. The base level is a guided filter (radius 3.2% of the long edge, ε = 1.5 in log2 units squared), with the gain measured as a function of that base level relative to an image key. The key is the 99th luminance percentile for Shadows and the median for Highlights. `src/develop/local_tone.rs` computes the base level on a 512 px copy of the photo, so tiles, 100% regions and previews agree, and applies the measured tables in `local_tone_data.rs` after the profile tone curve.

| Slider | −100 | −60 | −30 | +30 | +60 | +100 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Shadows | +0.0025 | +0.0014 (+0.0343) | +0.0007 | +0.0006 | +0.0037 (+0.0389) | +0.0102 |
| Highlights | +0.0060 | +0.0025 (+0.0014) | +0.0000 | +0.0014 | +0.0032 (+0.0054) | — |

### Dehaze

Dehaze is mostly a per-photo tone curve with a spatial residual. A single curve per photo explains ±40 to 0.011–0.019 MAE (from 0.04–0.11 unchanged). Engine 4 applies the curve averaged across photos, before Contrast in the same composed curve. Extra MAE over the default render: +0.0078 / +0.0135 at +40 / −40 (previously +0.037 / +0.062), +0.0021 / +0.0045 at ±20, and +0.036 / +0.044 at ±100, where the per-photo adaptation dominates.

## Auto

The Basic panel's **Auto** (the button beside Tone, or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U) sets white balance and the six Tone sliders; **Auto** in the WB menu sets white balance alone. `rawmakase render --auto` applies the same estimate from the command line. The implementation is `src/develop/auto.rs`; it keeps every other setting, and the app runs it off the UI thread and records one History step.

- **White balance** starts from As Shot. Each of three passes averages the camera pixels that look nearly neutral under the previous estimate, with a tighter tolerance each time (normalised chromaticity distance 0.5, 0.25, 0.12), so a large coloured surface pulls less than in plain gray world. Plain gray world is the fallback when under 2% of the photo qualifies. Pixels near clipping or in the noise floor are ignored, and each channel's correction is limited to two stops.
- **Tone** is fitted by rendering a 256 px copy of the photo through the normal pipeline and measuring the display-encoded result, so the estimate follows the sliders as they actually render. Exposure puts the median luminance at 0.46 (18% gray), found by the secant method, then gives up at most 1 EV of that while more than 1% of pixels would clip. Highlights (up to −60) and Shadows (up to +50) scale with the 97th and 5th luminance percentiles, and Contrast (−20 to +25) with the interquartile spread. Whites places the brightest channel of the brightest 0.2% at 0.97 and Blacks the darkest 0.2% at 0.015, each solved against renders; they are limited to −50…+35 and −50…+20 because strong positive Whites is not yet image-adaptive (below) and lifted Blacks looks flat. When highlights are clipped in the camera, Whites stays at 0 and Highlights does the recovery.

A photo takes 10–20 small renders; on 45-megapixel Nikon Z files that was 0.2–0.6 s with 8 CPU threads, including reducing the photo. The targets were tuned by eye on Nikon Z photos and have not been measured against Lightroom's Auto values.

## Remaining

- Positive Whites needs the image-adaptive white point. The table is a median, which is poor on photos with dim highlights at +100.
- Contrast's photo-dependent pivot is not yet modeled. The averaged curve already matches within about 0.005.
- Clarity and Texture still use the earlier operators. Dehaze at ±100 needs its per-photo adaptation (airlight estimate) and spatial component.
